# Week 1: Learn the Fundamentals
- *Topics:*
  - Basic Syntax
  - Data Types, Variables
  - Loops
  - Conditionals
  - Functions
  - Exception Handling
- *Mini-Project:* Create a simple calculator that can perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Add error handling for invalid input.

# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- *Topics:*
  - OOP Concepts (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
  - Interfaces
  - Packages
  - Data Structures
- *Mini-Project:* Build a simple Library Management System. Implement features like adding books, borrowing books, and returning books using OOP principles.

# Week 3: File Handling and APIs
- *Topics:*
  - Working with Files
  - Basic API usage (consuming REST APIs)
- *Mini-Project:* Develop a text-based file manager where users can create, delete, read, and write to files. Add the ability to fetch data from a public API (e.g., weather API) and display it.

# Week 4: Build Tools
- *Topics:*
  - Gradle
  - Maven
  - Ant
- *Mini-Project:* Convert the previous projects into Maven or Gradle projects. Use these tools to manage dependencies and build your project.

# Week 5: JDBC and Database Interaction
- *Topics:*
  - JDBC
  - JdbcTemplate
  - Jdbi3
- *Mini-Project:* Extend the Library Management System to connect with a MySQL/PostgreSQL database. Implement CRUD operations for managing books and users.

# Week 6: Getting Deeper
- *Topics:*
  - Memory Management
  - Collection Framework
  - Serialization
  - Networking & Sockets
- *Mini-Project:* Build a simple Chat Application using Sockets. Add the ability to serialize messages and deserialize them on the receiver's side.

# Week 7: Web Frameworks
- *Topics:*
  - Spring
  - Spring Boot
  - Play Framework / Struts
- *Mini-Project:* Develop a REST API for your Library Management System using Spring Boot. Implement features like adding books, fetching books, and managing users.

# Week 8: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- *Topics:*
  - Hibernate
  - JPA
  - EBean
  - Spring Data JPA
- *Mini-Project:* Integrate Hibernate or Spring Data JPA into your Spring Boot application to handle database operations. Use an ORM to map your Java objects to database tables.

# Week 9: Testing and Logging
- *Topics:*
  - Testing (JUnit, Mockito, JBehave)
  - Logging Frameworks (Log4j2, SLF4J, Logback)
- *Mini-Project:* Write unit tests for your Library Management System using JUnit and Mockito. Add logging to track application behavior using Log4j2 or SLF4J.
